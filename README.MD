Gameboy emulator written in Android(Java) using LibGDX

CPU: WIP.

Link cable: Basic "console" output.

PPU/GPU: Over my head.

Sound: Last priority.

MBC1: Work will start soon.

1/10/14: Working on adding comments and TODOs for future me.
The MBC1 is being worked on, but right now, I need a way 
to actually switch banks, by detecting when bytes are written
to certain places in memory
